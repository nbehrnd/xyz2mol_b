  Given an input structure as .xyz file, the moderator script ~xyz2mol_b.py~
  provides a representation in the .sdf format.  The user is expected to
  describe the overall charge by flag ~-c~ (or ~--charge~) if the molecule is
  not neutral.  Based on Jan Jensen's work on ~xyz2mol~[fn:1], it depends on a
  recent release of RDKit (e.g., 2023.03.2).  It is suggested to resolve the
  dependencies in an activated virtual environment for Python and a call of

  #+begin_src shell :results nil :tangle no
pip -r install requirements.txt
  #+end_src

  and eventually use the script in a pattern like

  #+begin_src shell :results nil :tangle no
python ./xyz2mol_b.py ./acetate.xyz --charge -1
  #+end_src

  Based on an algorithm by Kim and Kim[fn:0], Jan Jensen implemented
  xyz2mol[fn:1] relying on RDKit.  As presented in 2020 ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD6IpXMVKeo][recording]], [[https://github.com/rdkit/UGM_2020/blob/master/Presentations/JanJensen.pdf][pdf slides]]),
  the approach works best on small molecules which do not carry organometallic
  bonds.

  With releaseÂ 2202.09.3, the functionality is available in RDKit.[fn:2] This
  allows a shorter (moderator) script to convert xyz into .sdf provided one
  actually has access to a version of RDKit modern enough: contrasting to Greg
  Landrum's blog,[fn:3] RDKit 2022.09.3 as so far packaged for Linux Debian does
  not yet include this functionality -- according to repology.org,[fn:4] this
  equally applies to relatives via DebiChem (e.g. Ubuntu ecosystem).  As
  checked, creating a virtual environment for Python and a pip based
  installation of RDKit 2023.03.2 (and its dependencies such as numpy) offers
  one successful bypass.  An alternative environment not tested may be anaconda.

  The script was written in an instance of Linux Debian 13/trixie (branch
  testing) with Python (version 3.11.4) and pip installed RDKit (2202.09.3).  As
  inspected with openbabel and Jmol, Jan Jensen's four test structures pass the
  conversion.
